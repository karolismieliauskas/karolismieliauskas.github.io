body: |
  Ride out to Morocco happened in December 2015 with a start in Alicante, Spain. Tangier, Marrakesh, Ouarzazate, Atlas passes, Camels and sand storm on a way - all just stunning but desert ride and meeting of nomads is why i went there back in the day. 5000km of paved and unpaved roads + Sahara desert with just sand. A lot of sand. Alone.

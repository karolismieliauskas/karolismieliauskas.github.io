  Ride out to Morocco happened in December 2015 with a start in Alicante, Spain. Tangier, Marrakesh, Ouarzazate, Atlas passes, Camels and sand storm on a way - all just stunning but dessert ride and meeting of nomads is why i went there back in the day. 5000km of paved and unpaved roads + Sahara desert with just sand. A lot of sand. Alone.

      I'm planing to reach coldest spot on earth with this very same Yamaha Tenere you are seeing in these pictures. Yet this time I need more preparation and resources to make this a reality.

      I'm looking for companies and individuals, who would like to become parners and arange sponsorship for the journey. Tap the button bellow to find out more details

      Mountainous region and sometimes partly unfrozen rivers, which will be needed to pass, will be 'a cherry on a pie' just before finish.

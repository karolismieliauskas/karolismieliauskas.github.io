    I' am Karolis Mieliauskas 36 y.o. father and for me tough motorcycle ride is a perfect method of active meditation. Motorbike plays as a tool to test upper limits of my performance and to explore the self.

    I mostly travel alone and like to ride 1000km a day on my single cylinder 600cc motorbike.

    Starting in Yakutsk and Finishishing Oymyakon, we will travel for 5 days on the most treacherous roads in the world.

    Some serious temperature drop downs are expected all the way. Starting in Yakutsk, which average temperatures in February are -40 Celcius, we'll reach Oymyakon this -60C

    Mountainous region and sometimes partly unfrozen rivers, which will be needed to pass, will be 'a cherry on a pie' just before finish.

    Starting in Yakutsk and finishing in Oymyakon_the coldest inhabited place on earth, i will travel on the most treacherous roads in the world.

    Some serious temperature drop downs are expected all the way. Yakutsk temperature in a morning of February is -40 Celsius and drops to -60 Celsius in Oymyakon.

    Mountainous region and sometimes partly unfrozen rivers will be 'a cherry on a pie' just before finish of extremely cold 1000km ride.

    I am Karolis Mieliauskas 36 y.o. father and for me tough motorcycle ride is a perfect method for active meditation. Motorbike plays as a tool to test upper limits of own performance and to explore the self.

    I mostly travel alone and like to ride 1000km a day on my single cylinder all around motorbike.

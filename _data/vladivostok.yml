  Ride to the sea of Japan happened in July 2016. Siberian wilderness, magic lake of Baikal, endless steppes and taigas, outstanding views, millions of mosquitoes and so friendly people all the way. And all this was not a main reason to go. Magicness of '1000km a day' was. So this active meditation took me 11000 km in 12 days and two days of rest. Alone.

  Check some of the moments from Long ride:

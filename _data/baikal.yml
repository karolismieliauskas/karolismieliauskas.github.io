  title: "Across the frozen Baikal"
body: |
 I have found myself on the ice of the deepest lake in the world Baikal in March 2017. Nearly 800 km weeks long journey in extreme winter conditions, far from the shores with massive ice fractures full of open water in the freezing temperatures with no support and any electrically heated garments. In fact with no camping gear or satellite phone. Alone.

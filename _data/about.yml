    For me motorcycle ride is a perfect method of active meditation. In my matter motorcycle plays as a tool to test upper limits of my performance and to explore the self by witnessing. Witnessing of internal oceans, breath, mind and whatever eyes may see. I believe that horizons of consciousness are so wide that constant cognition of it is one of the most important things in life.

    Mostly i travel alone and like to ride 1000 km a day on my single cylinder Yamaha. Which is a lot for a all around bike. A lot of trust then needed to remain focused with no focus and still to see what's in front. To remain riding.

    > "My left shoulder blade hurts so badly for the 5th day already that i hardly find any position on a bike, but i am about to hit another 1000km today. I am on a road for 6 days with 6000km behind me. Incredible views are all the way, i feel all the smells of Siberian taiga (and old cars :) ), fresh and hot air, i see sunrises and sunsets, i see my thoughts and this idea of pain. But it has no chances to remain and will pass...as the rest."

    At that time i had another lone ride in some extreme winter conditions, far from the shores, with massive ice fractures full of open water in the freezing temperatures with no support and any electrically heated garments.

    That's how Liora Malts from The Brake Magazine [in her article](http://www.brake-magazine.com/feature-the-one-life-lesson-we-all-need/) describes me :) :

    As a speaker i share emotions with attractive presentations for companies, schools, communities.

    I speak about goal setting, motivation, risk taking and fear of fail, team work, dealing with change, and achieving what was set out to achieve, no matter what are the obstacles.
